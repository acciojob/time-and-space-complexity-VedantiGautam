	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to run, relative to the size of the input. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, which means they can process data quickly even as the data size grows.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a concept that refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to solve a problem based on the size of the input. It is often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Algorithms with lower space complexity use less memory, which is crucial in resource-constrained environments.</p>
