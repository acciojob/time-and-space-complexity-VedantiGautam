	<h1> Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	 <p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm has a low time complexity, which means it can solve a problem quickly, even for large inputs.</p>

		 <p>Space Complexity is another crucial aspect of algorithm analysis. It assesses the amount of memory an algorithm needs to execute. One way to express space complexity is using Big O notation, often written as <b>O(n)</b>. <b>Space Complexity</b> is essential to ensure efficient memory usage in algorithm design.</p>
