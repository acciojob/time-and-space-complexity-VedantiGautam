	<h1> Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time Complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. 
	   It measures the time that is efficient to execute each statement of code in an algorithm</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b>refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.
		O(n) is usually the space complexity of an algorithm.
